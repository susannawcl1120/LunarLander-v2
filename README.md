# LunarLander-v2

The training model of LunarLander-v2 is using SARSA as policy in OpenAI gym box2D environment.

It requires keras-rl 2 as the framework and trains on the Google Colab.

Neural network is the important in the model, changing the hyper parameters can received a better result. The following shows the demostration video:
